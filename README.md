<!-- FAQ -->
## :grey_question: FAQ

- Why did you decide to build this app instead of something different?

  + I love collecting books but my memory isn't that great, so it's difficult when I'm at the bookstore and can't always remember if I own this book or I've read that book. Having a digital library keeps track of that for me. I also haven't found a similar app that I like for various reasons. The entry is always tedious, but I'd like to at least have something nice to look at while I work.

- What are your plans for this app in the future?

  + I want to add more functionality to the book list. I'd like to be able to sort and filter, as well as edit a book directly from its entry rather than deleting it and starting over. I'd also love to develop this into a mobile app once I have the knowledge.
